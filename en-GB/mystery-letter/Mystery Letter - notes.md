title: Mystery Letter — Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children are introduced to CSS classes. They use multiple CSS classes to style text and also learn how to use background images free Google fonts in their projects. 


#Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinket:

+ ['Mystery Letter' starting point  -- jumpto.cc/web-letter](jumpto.cc/web-letter)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-blank)](jumpto.cc/trinket-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-template)](jumpto.cc/trinket-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Mystery Letter Finished' -- trinket.io/html/trinkets/1d4d4c5ce1](https://trinket.io/html/trinkets/1d4d4c5ce1)
